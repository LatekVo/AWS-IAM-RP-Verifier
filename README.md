### Key notes

#### File structure
This codebase follows project structure recommendations described in the https://go.dev/ documentation.

#### Tests
Tests have no dedicated folder for the tests themselves besides the data folder. This is the standard recommended by go's documentation. 

This ensures high code coverage as there is a clear association being made between the tests and the code they're testing.
